"""Sprint 8 Critical Path E2E Tests - Sprint 2 (Vector Search Foundation).

This module contains E2E integration tests for Sprint 2 critical paths per SPRINT_8_PLAN.md:
- Test 2.1: Full Document Ingestion Pipeline E2E (1 SP)
- Test 2.2: Hybrid Search Latency Validation E2E (1 SP)
- Test 2.3: Embedding Service Batch Performance E2E (0.5 SP)
- Test 2.4: Qdrant Connection Pooling E2E (0.5 SP)

All tests use real services (NO MOCKS) per ADR-014.

Test Strategy:
- Sprint 2 already has 40% E2E coverage (good baseline)
- These tests add full pipeline validation
- Focus on performance baselines and edge cases

Services Required:
- Ollama (nomic-embed-text for embeddings)
- Qdrant (vector storage)

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the
    development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to
    improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

    The field of machine learning emerged from the quest for artificial intelligence.
    Early research in the field explored various approaches, including symbolic
    approaches and connectionist approaches similar to neural networks.

    Modern machine learning has two main categories: supervised learning and
    unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves training models on labeled
    data, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find patterns.

    Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial
    neural networks with multiple layers. These networks can learn hierarchical
    representations of data, making them powerful for tasks like image recognition.

    Applications of machine learning are diverse and growing rapidly. They include
    recommendation systems, natural language processing, computer vision, fraud
    detection, and autonomous vehicles.
