"""Integration Tests for Gemma Retry Logic - Sprint 14 Feature 14.5.

Tests retry logic with real Ollama service to verify:
- Resilience to transient failures
- Exponential backoff behavior
- Graceful degradation
- Real-world error scenarios

Requirements:
- Ollama running on localhost:11434
- Model: hf.co/MaziyarPanahi/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF:Q4_K_M
