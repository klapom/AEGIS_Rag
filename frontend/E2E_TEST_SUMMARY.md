# AEGIS RAG Frontend E2E Test Suite Summary

**Sprint 15 - React Application Testing**
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Total Tests Created**: 144 test cases

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) test suite has been created for the AEGIS RAG Frontend application. The test suite covers all major user workflows, error scenarios, and integration points using Vitest and React Testing Library.

### Current Test Results

```
Test Files: 7 total (4 failed, 3 passed)
Tests:      144 total (39 failed, 105 passed)
Duration:   35.75s
```

**Pass Rate**: 72.9% (105/144 tests passing)

The failing tests are primarily due to incomplete mock implementations for the SSE streaming functionality. These are expected failures that can be resolved by enhancing the mock utilities.

{
  environment: 'jsdom',
  setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
  globals: true,
  coverage: {
    provider: 'v8',
    reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html']
  }
}
```

## Test Categories

2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions (HomePage → SearchResultsPage)
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows (search → streaming → results)
4. **Error Tests**: Error handling and recovery
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

### By Priority

**P0 - Critical** (73 tests):
- User can search and see results
- Streaming works correctly
- Error messages display
- Navigation flows work

**P1 - Important** (48 tests):
- Mode selection works
- Quick prompts work
- URL encoding correct
- Sources display

**P2 - Nice to Have** (23 tests):
- Edge cases
- Accessibility features
- Long query handling
- Special character support

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Failing Tests

The 39 failing tests are primarily due to:

1. **Mock Implementation Gaps**:
   - SSE streaming mock needs enhancement to properly handle async iteration
   - Some tests require more sophisticated mock data

2. **Timing Issues**:
   - Some async tests timeout waiting for elements
   - waitFor conditions need adjustment

3. **Integration Challenges**:
   - Full workflow tests require better router mock setup
   - State persistence between test steps needs work

### Recommendations for Resolution

1. **Enhance Mock Utilities**:
   ```typescript
   // Improve streamChat mock in helpers.ts
   export function mockStreamChatImplementation() {
     return async function* (request: ChatRequest) {
       yield* createMockSSEStream(chunks);
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Async Timing**:
   - Increase timeouts for complex streaming tests
   - Add better synchronization points
   - Use `act()` wrapper for state updates

3. **Improve Router Mocking**:
   - Create more realistic router context
   - Handle navigation state properly
   - Test actual route transitions

## Running the Tests
