# ADR-015: Critical Path Testing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision Makers:** Development Team
**Related:** ADR-014 (E2E Integration Testing Strategy)

---

## Context

After implementing Sprint 7 with comprehensive E2E testing (ADR-014), we analyzed Sprint 1-6 test coverage and identified **26 critical integration paths** with insufficient or zero E2E validation. Historical evidence from Sprint 6 proved that mocked tests provide false confidence:

**Sprint 6 Incident (October 2025):**
- **Symptom:** All unit tests passed with mocked Neo4j
- **Reality:** Integration tests failed in CI with real Neo4j (timeout issues)
- **Impact:** 2 days debugging, multiple iterations to fix health checks
- **Root Cause:** Mocked Neo4j didn't simulate real startup time or connection behavior

This incident revealed a **systemic risk**: critical integration paths were validated only by mocked tests, leaving production deployment vulnerable to integration failures.

### Current State Analysis

**Test Coverage (Pre-Sprint 8):**
```
Total Tests: ~470 test functions across 70 test files
‚îú‚îÄ Mocked Unit Tests: 432 tests (92%)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Fast execution (<2 min)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ High coverage metrics (80%+)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ False confidence (mocks ‚â† reality)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ E2E Integration: 38 tests (8%)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Sprint 7 only (Memory System)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Real services (Redis, Qdrant, Neo4j, Ollama)
   ‚îî‚îÄ High confidence (validates actual behavior)

Production Confidence: 75% ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

| Sprint | Component | Critical Paths | E2E Coverage | Risk |
|--------|-----------|----------------|--------------|------|
| Sprint 6 | Neo4j Graph Operations | 13 paths | **0%** | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| Sprint 5 | LightRAG Integration | 15 paths | **0%** | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| Sprint 3 | Advanced Retrieval | 13 paths | **7%** | üü† HIGH |
| Sprint 4 | LangGraph Orchestration | 8 paths | **25%** | üü° MEDIUM |
| Sprint 2 | Vector Search | 10 paths | **40%** | üü¢ GOOD |

**12 paths have ZERO E2E coverage:**
1. Community Detection (Neo4j + Ollama LLM labeling)
2. Query Optimization (CypherQueryBuilder + Cache)
3. Cross-Encoder Reranking (sentence-transformers model)
4. RAGAS Evaluation (Ollama LLM for answer generation)
5. LightRAG Entity Extraction (Ollama ‚Üí Neo4j)
6. Graph Construction (Full pipeline)
7. Dual-Level Search (Local + Global)
8. PageRank Analytics (Real graph computation)
9. Temporal Queries (Bi-temporal model)
10. Query Decomposition (JSON parsing)
11. Metadata Filtering (Qdrant filters)
12. Adaptive Chunking (Document-type detection)

### Strategic Question

> "How do we increase production confidence from 75% ‚Üí 95% without migrating all 432 mocked tests?"

---

## Decision

**We adopt a Critical Path Testing Strategy for Sprint 8:**

1. **Identify Critical Paths:** Systematically analyze Sprint 1-6 for high-risk integration points
2. **Prioritize by Risk:** Focus on paths with zero E2E coverage and high production impact
3. **Target Coverage:** Add 40 E2E tests (40 SP) to validate all critical paths
4. **Preserve Existing Tests:** Keep mocked unit tests as-is (no migration)
5. **Measure Impact:** Track production confidence improvement (75% ‚Üí 95%)

**Sprint 8 becomes:** "Critical Path E2E Integration Testing"

### Scope

**In Scope (Sprint 8):**
- ‚úÖ 40 E2E tests for 26 critical paths (highest risk)
- ‚úÖ Real services (Redis, Qdrant, Neo4j, Ollama)
- ‚úÖ Full stack validation (API ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Component ‚Üí Database)
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking (real latency)
- ‚úÖ Error scenario testing (real service failures)

**Out of Scope:**
- ‚ùå Migrate all 432 mocked tests to E2E (too expensive)
- ‚ùå New feature development (100% focus on testing)
- ‚ùå Unit test coverage improvements (already 80%+)

---

## Rationale

### Why Critical Path Testing?

**1. Risk-Based Approach**
- Focus on **highest risk** paths (12 with zero E2E coverage)
- Maximize ROI: 40 tests (8% of suite) ‚Üí 95% confidence
- Pragmatic: Don't test everything, test what matters

**2. Historical Evidence**
- Sprint 6 proved: Mocked tests miss real integration issues
- Community Detection untested ‚Üí could fail in production
- LightRAG untested ‚Üí could produce corrupt graphs
- RAGAS untested ‚Üí unreliable evaluation results

**3. Production Impact**
- **Without Sprint 8:** 12 critical paths vulnerable to failures
- **With Sprint 8:** All critical paths validated
- **Expected:** 80% reduction in integration bugs (10/quarter ‚Üí 2/quarter)

**4. Cost-Benefit Analysis**

| Metric | Without Sprint 8 | With Sprint 8 | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| E2E Coverage | 8% (38 tests) | 16% (78 tests) | +100% |
| Production Confidence | 75% | 95% | +27% |
| Integration Bugs | 10/quarter | 2/quarter | -80% |
| CI Debugging Time | 5 hours/week | 1 hour/week | -80% |
| **Investment** | - | 160 hours (4 weeks) | - |
| **Annual Savings** | - | 208 hours (4h/week √ó 52) | **130% ROI** |

## Critical Path Identification Framework

### Definition: What is a "Critical Path"?

A critical path is an **integration point** where:
1. **Multiple services interact** (e.g., Ollama ‚Üí Neo4j, Qdrant ‚Üí LLM)
2. **Failure has high impact** (core feature broken, data corruption, crash)
3. **Current coverage is inadequate** (zero or insufficient E2E tests)
4. **Mocks don't validate reality** (timing, errors, edge cases)

### Risk Assessment Matrix

For each path, we evaluate:

| Factor | Weight | Scoring |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Production Impact** | 40% | 1=Low (UI glitch), 5=Critical (data loss) |
| **Failure Likelihood** | 30% | 1=Rare, 5=Frequent (Sprint 6 evidence) |
| **Current Coverage** | 20% | 1=Good E2E, 5=Zero E2E |
| **Complexity** | 10% | 1=Simple, 5=Multi-service orchestration |

**Risk Score = Œ£(Factor √ó Weight)**

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Risk score ‚â• 4.0 ‚Üí Must have in Sprint 8
- **P1 (High):** Risk score 3.0-3.9 ‚Üí Should have
- **P2 (Medium):** Risk score 2.0-2.9 ‚Üí Nice to have

### Example: Community Detection Path

| Factor | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Production Impact | 5 (Feature broken) | 40% | 2.0 |
| Failure Likelihood | 4 (Complex, untested) | 30% | 1.2 |
| Current Coverage | 5 (Zero E2E) | 20% | 1.0 |
| Complexity | 4 (Neo4j + Ollama + LLM) | 10% | 0.4 |
| **Total Risk Score** | | | **4.6** |

**Result:** P0 (Critical) ‚Üí Must include in Sprint 8

### Test Structure Pattern

All Sprint 8 tests follow this pattern:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.critical  # New marker for critical path tests
async def test_[component]_[feature]_e2e([real_service_fixtures]):
    """E2E: [Description of critical path being validated].

    Critical Path: [Service A] ‚Üí [Service B] ‚Üí [Service C]
    Risk Level: [P0/P1/P2]
    Coverage Gap: [What was missing before this test]
    """
    # Given: Setup with real services
    # When: Execute critical path
    # Then: Verify behavior with real services
    # Then: Validate performance targets
    # Then: Test error scenarios (if applicable)
```

**Example:**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.critical
async def test_community_detection_leiden_e2e(neo4j_driver, ollama_client_real):
    """E2E: Community detection with Leiden algorithm and LLM labeling.

    Critical Path: Neo4j (graph) ‚Üí Leiden (detection) ‚Üí Ollama (labeling)
    Risk Level: P0 (CRITICAL - Zero current coverage)
    Coverage Gap: Never tested with real Neo4j + real Ollama

    Validates:
    - NetworkX Leiden algorithm works with real graph data
    - Neo4j graph projection succeeds
    - Ollama LLM generates valid labels (not mocked responses)
    - Modularity score calculation is correct
    - Performance target (<30s for 100 nodes)
    """
    # Test implementation...
```

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Migrate All Tests to E2E

**Approach:** Convert all 432 mocked tests to E2E

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ 100% E2E coverage
- ‚úÖ Maximum confidence

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå 1,000+ hours effort (prohibitive)
- ‚ùå Test suite time: 2 minutes ‚Üí 40 minutes
- ‚ùå Destroys fast feedback loop
- ‚ùå Breaks existing working tests

**Decision:** ‚ùå Rejected - Cost >> Benefit

---

### Alternative 2: Continue with Mocked Tests Only

**Approach:** Keep current strategy, no Sprint 8

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No additional effort
- ‚úÖ Fast test execution

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå 75% confidence stays (insufficient for production)
- ‚ùå Sprint 6-style failures continue (10 bugs/quarter)
- ‚ùå High CI debugging cost (5 hours/week)
- ‚ùå Production deployment risk

**Decision:** ‚ùå Rejected - Risk too high (Sprint 6 proved inadequacy)

---

### Alternative 3: Critical Path Testing (SELECTED)

**Approach:** Target 40 E2E tests for highest-risk paths

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ 95% confidence achieved
- ‚úÖ 162% ROI (cost-effective)
- ‚úÖ All critical paths validated
- ‚úÖ Keeps existing tests intact
- ‚úÖ Test suite time: <20 minutes (acceptable)

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical paths remain mocked (acceptable trade-off)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 4-week investment required

**Decision:** ‚úÖ Accepted - Optimal risk/benefit balance

---

## Integration with ADR-014

ADR-014 established **E2E testing as the standard for new features** (Sprint 7+).

ADR-015 extends this to **validate existing critical paths** (Sprint 1-6).

**Combined Strategy:**
```
New Features (Sprint 7+):
‚îî‚îÄ ADR-014: E2E testing from day 1 (NO MOCKS)

Existing Code (Sprint 1-6):
‚îî‚îÄ ADR-015: Critical Path E2E testing (targeted, risk-based)
```

**Result:** Comprehensive E2E coverage across entire system

---

## Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

### Sprint 8+ Ongoing Strategy

**1. Critical Path Registry**
- Maintain list of all critical paths in `docs/testing/CRITICAL_PATHS.md`
- Update when new integration points added
- Review quarterly for new risks

**2. Coverage Tracking**
```python
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    critical: Critical path E2E test (must pass for production)
```

**CI Dashboard:**
- Track critical path test pass rate (target: 100%)
- Alert if critical test fails (P0 incident)

**3. Risk Re-assessment**
- Every sprint: Review if new critical paths emerged
- Annual: Re-run risk matrix for all paths
- Add E2E tests for new P0 paths within 1 sprint

**4. Performance Baselines**
- Track critical path latency trends
- Alert if degradation >20%
- Use for capacity planning

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Write a Critical Path Test

**Decision Tree:**
```
Does the path involve multiple services?
‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Unit test sufficient
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Continue

Would failure impact core functionality?
‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Unit test sufficient
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Continue

Does it have E2E coverage?
‚îú‚îÄ YES (>80%) ‚Üí Enhance if needed
‚îî‚îÄ NO (<80%) ‚Üí Write critical path E2E test

Is it complex (LLM, real-time, stateful)?
‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Consider unit test
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Write critical path E2E test (HIGH PRIORITY)
```

### Test Template

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.critical
async def test_[component]_[feature]_critical_e2e(
    [real_service_fixtures]
):
    """E2E: [One-line description of critical path].

    Critical Path: [Service A] ‚Üí [Service B] ‚Üí [Service C]
    Risk Level: P0/P1/P2
    Risk Score: [X.X] (Impact: X, Likelihood: X, Coverage: X)
    Coverage Gap: [What was untested before]
    Sprint: [Original sprint where feature was added]

    Validates:
    - [Real behavior 1 that mocks can't validate]
    - [Real behavior 2 that mocks can't validate]
    - [Performance target with real services]
    - [Error handling with real failures]

    Historical Context:
    - [Why this test was needed - link to incident if applicable]
    """
    # Given: Setup test scenario with real services

    # When: Execute critical path

    # Then: Verify behavior

    # Then: Validate performance

    # Then: Test error scenarios (if applicable)
```

---

## Lessons Learned from Sprint 6

**Incident:** Neo4j integration tests failed despite passing unit tests

**What Went Wrong:**
1. ‚ùå Mocked Neo4j didn't simulate real startup time (60-90s)
2. ‚ùå Health check logic untested with real cypher-shell
3. ‚ùå Connection pool behavior different in CI vs local
4. ‚ùå JVM heap configuration never validated

**What We Learned:**
1. ‚úÖ Mocks provide false confidence for integration points
2. ‚úÖ Service timing issues only caught with real services
3. ‚úÖ CI environment differs from local (slower, resource-constrained)
4. ‚úÖ Configuration issues require E2E validation

**How Sprint 8 Prevents This:**
- ‚úÖ All Neo4j integration paths get E2E tests
- ‚úÖ Service startup, health checks, and timing validated
- ‚úÖ CI runs same E2E tests as local
- ‚úÖ Configuration tested in realistic CI environment

---

## Compliance & Governance

### Definition of Done (Sprint 8)

For each critical path test:
- [ ] Test uses real services (NO MOCKS)
- [ ] Test validates full integration path
- [ ] Test includes performance validation
- [ ] Test includes error scenario (if applicable)
- [ ] Test has clear documentation (docstring)
- [ ] Test passes in CI with real services
- [ ] Test added to critical path registry

### Code Review Checklist

When reviewing Sprint 8 tests:
- [ ] Are real services used? (No mocks, no patches)
- [ ] Does it test the full critical path? (Not just one hop)
- [ ] Are performance targets validated? (Latency, throughput)
- [ ] Are error scenarios tested? (Service down, timeout)
- [ ] Is the test well-documented? (Why it's critical)
- [ ] Does it run in CI? (Docker Compose services)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Post-Sprint 8 Improvements

**Short-term (Sprint 9-10):**
1. Parallelize test execution (pytest-xdist -n 4)
   - Expected: 20 min ‚Üí 7 min execution time
2. Add test sharding in CI
   - Expected: 4 parallel jobs, 5 min total

**Medium-term (6 months):**
1. Critical path coverage dashboard
   - Visualize risk matrix
   - Track coverage trends
   - Alert on new high-risk paths
2. Automated critical path detection
   - Static analysis to identify integration points
   - Suggest E2E tests for new features

**Long-term (1 year):**
1. Chaos engineering for critical paths
   - Random service failures
   - Network latency injection
   - Resource exhaustion testing
2. Production canary testing
   - Run critical path tests in production (read-only)
   - Detect regressions before user impact

---

## Conclusion

**Sprint 8 Critical Path Testing is a strategic investment in production reliability.**

By focusing on the **26 critical integration paths** with insufficient E2E coverage, we achieve:
- ‚úÖ **95% production confidence** (up from 75%)
- ‚úÖ **100% critical path validation** (26/26 paths)
- ‚úÖ **80% reduction in integration bugs** (10/quarter ‚Üí 2/quarter)
- ‚úÖ **162% ROI** (260 hours saved annually vs 160 hours invested)

This complements ADR-014 (E2E testing for new features) to create a comprehensive testing strategy:
- **New Features:** E2E from day 1 (ADR-014)
- **Existing Code:** Critical path E2E (ADR-015)
- **Result:** Full system confidence without migrating all tests

**Decision:** ‚úÖ Accepted and scheduled for Sprint 8
