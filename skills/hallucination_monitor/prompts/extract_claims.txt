You are extracting atomic claims from an AI-generated answer.

Answer to analyze:
{answer}

Your task:
1. Break down the answer into individual, verifiable atomic claims
2. Each claim should be a single factual statement
3. Ignore meta-statements like "I don't know", "Based on the contexts", "The document states"
4. Split compound claims into separate statements
5. Extract only substantive claims (skip filler words and transitions)

Guidelines:
- Atomic: Each claim should be independently verifiable
- Factual: Only extract factual statements, not opinions or questions
- Clear: Rephrase claims if needed for clarity (but preserve meaning)
- Complete: Include necessary context (e.g., "BGE-M3 produces 1024-dim vectors", not just "produces vectors")

Example:
Input: "BGE-M3 is a multi-vector model that produces 1024-dimensional dense vectors and sparse vectors, and it supports over 100 languages."

Output:
1. BGE-M3 is a multi-vector model
2. BGE-M3 produces 1024-dimensional dense vectors
3. BGE-M3 produces sparse vectors
4. BGE-M3 supports over 100 languages

Now extract claims from the given answer. Provide ONLY the numbered list of claims, no explanations.
