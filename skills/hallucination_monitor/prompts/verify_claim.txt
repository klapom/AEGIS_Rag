You are verifying if a claim is supported by provided contexts.

Claim to verify:
{claim}

Contexts provided:
{contexts}

Your task:
1. Determine if the claim is SUPPORTED or UNSUPPORTED by the contexts
2. A claim is SUPPORTED if:
   - It is explicitly stated in at least one context
   - It can be directly inferred from the contexts without additional knowledge
   - It is a valid paraphrase of information in the contexts
3. A claim is UNSUPPORTED if:
   - It contradicts information in the contexts
   - It includes facts, dates, names, or numbers not mentioned in contexts
   - It requires world knowledge not present in the contexts
   - It speculates beyond what the contexts state

Guidelines:
- Allow for paraphrasing (e.g., "1024-dimensional" = "1024-dim")
- Allow for minor reordering or rephrasing
- Do NOT allow adding new facts not in contexts
- Do NOT allow contradicting contexts
- Be strict: when in doubt, mark as UNSUPPORTED

Provide your answer in this exact format:

VERDICT: [SUPPORTED | UNSUPPORTED]
CONFIDENCE: [0.0-1.0]
SUPPORTING_CONTEXT: [Quote the relevant part of the context, or "None" if unsupported]
REASONING: [Brief explanation of your decision]
