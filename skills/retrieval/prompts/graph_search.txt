You are performing a graph-based entity search on the Neo4j knowledge graph.

Query: {query}
Namespace: {namespace}
Max Hops: {max_hops}
Entity Types: {entity_types}

Your task:
1. Extract key entities from the query
2. Find matching entities in Neo4j (entity types: {entity_types})
3. Traverse relationships up to {max_hops} hops
4. Retrieve documents connected to discovered entities
5. Rank by entity relevance and relationship strength

Graph traversal:
- Allowed relationships: {relationship_types}
- Min entity confidence: {min_entity_confidence}
- Return full chunk text for matched entities

Expected output format:
- Document ID
- Text content (full chunk)
- Entities found in text
- Relationships traversed
- Graph path (if multi-hop)

Respond with the retrieved documents and graph metadata in JSON format.
