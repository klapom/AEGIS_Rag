LIGHTRAG_PROMPT = """---Role---
You are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.

---Instructions---
1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.
    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:
        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case).
        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: [organization, person, location, product, event, date]. If none apply, classify it as `Other`.
        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities.
    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.
        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`

2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.
    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:
        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity.
        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity.
        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the relationship (comma-separated).
        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship.
    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.
        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`

3.  **Output Order:** Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.

4.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships have been completely extracted.

---Example---
Input: "Alex works at Control, coordinating with Taylor."
Output:
entity<|#|>Alex<|#|>person<|#|>Alex is a coordinator.
entity<|#|>Control<|#|>organization<|#|>Control is the central authority.
entity<|#|>Taylor<|#|>person<|#|>Taylor is a team member.
relation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Control<|#|>employment<|#|>Alex works at Control.
relation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Taylor<|#|>collaboration<|#|>Alex coordinates with Taylor.
<|COMPLETE|>

---Task---
Extract entities and relationships from the following text:

{text}
